This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

- `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
- `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
- `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
- `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
- `final` - Starter projects for final project.

## FinalProject

My final project is about a system to manage Departments (made up of courses), Classrooms (made up of a number for each room and students), Activities (made up of the name of the activity and its participants). In addition, it also manages the creation of Courses, Students and Teachers to be added to the corresponding areas.
